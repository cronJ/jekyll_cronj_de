Started working on an little ESP8266 project again. This time with an ESP-12 module from Ai-Thinker. Therefor I created an new part in Eagle after the specifications from Ai-Thinker ([Technical Specifications](http://wiki.ai-thinker.com/lib/exe/fetch.php/modules/esp-12_wifi.pdf)).

My purchased module has an slightly different silkscreen as shown in the document. On my module GPIO4 and GPIO5 are swapped and pin EN is labeled CH_PD. That should be checked before using the part.
